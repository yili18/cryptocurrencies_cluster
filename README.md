# cryptocurrencies_cluster

## The project is to use unsupervised learning to cluster cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods.

### Import and prepare data to find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
  * Use **Elbow Method** to find the best value for k
  
### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
  * Use **scratter plot** from hvplot
  
### Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

### Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
  * Use **Elbow Method** to find the best value for k
  
### Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
  *Use **scratter plot** from hvplot
  
### Visualize and Compare the Results
  * Use **plus operator** to composite plots side by side
